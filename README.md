## Data Preprocessing Pipeline

This is a data prep pipeline that handles binary, categorical, and numerical data. The sample data file ("Data_example.csv") contains multiple features.

### Binary features
- these are features that have two categories labeled either 1 or 0
- we want to keep the columns as they are

### Numerical categorical features
- these are features that have at least three numerical categories
- we want to tranform them into dummy variables

### Textual categorical features
- these are features that have at least three textual categories
- we want to tranform them into dummy variables

### Numercial features
- these features that are numerical such as integers and floats
- we want to normalize these values
